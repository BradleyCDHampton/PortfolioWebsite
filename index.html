        <p>Stream of Consciousness: Rewrite...
            I am a recent Graduate of Old Dominion University, currently accepted and enrolled in the Graduate Program. I enjoy challenges and strive to make an impact on any project I may work on.
            I am open to relocating anywhere and am hoping for my next opportunity to be valuable in continuing my aquisition of knowledge.
        
        
            Highly competitive and solution driven. 4+ years of experience supporting, building, 
            and empowering a team.
            
            
            Actively invests in the development of a team, including self-development. 
           
            seems a bit canned.

            which enables me to both leverage and expand my skillset identifying opportunities; 
            planning, designing, and implementing software; and supporting a team. 
        
        </p>

        <p>
            Current study and research interests include:
        </p>

            <li>Artificial Intelligence</lo>
            <li>Machine Learning</lo>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The homepage should be a rough summary of the website, don't make it too long. Briefly touch on projects and the resume.
            Conclude with a call to action to express interest in contacting/communicating/working.
