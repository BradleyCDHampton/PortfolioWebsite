        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>
            I am a Graduate of Old Dominion University, where I obtained a B.S. in Computer Science (December 2024).
            I am currently pursuing a M.S. in Computer Science at ODU, which an anticipated completion date of December 2025.
            
            As highly competitive and solution-driven individual, I thrive in any projects that challenge me to think critically,
            expand my depth of knowledge, and allow me to pull ideas from many different experiences.

            <p>
                Ongoing study and research interests include:
            </p>
    
            <ul>
                <li>Quantum Computing</lo>
                <li>Artificial Intelligence</lo>
                <li>Machine Learning</lo>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
                I value communication, collaboration, and empowerment of a teamâ€”especially in an Agile team structure.

                Seeking an opportunity where continuous, professional development is prioritized. I am open to relocating
                anywhere in the United States and am hoping for my next opportunity to be valuable in continuing my aquisition
                of knowledge.
